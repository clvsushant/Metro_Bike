# LA Metro BikeShare 

The Metro Bike Share system makes bikes available 24/7, 365 days a year in Downtown LA, Central LA, North Hollywood and the Westside. Metro Bike Share offers convenient round-the-clock access to a fleet of bicycles for short trips. Metro Bike Share is one of LA Metro's multiple public transportation options for Angelenos and visitors to get around.

I analyzed consumer behavior in terms of membership types, volumes of trips by day, monthly, popular routes and visualizations in the Greater Los Angeles area in 2017. Based on these findings, I can provide meaningful data to adjust station locations, number of bike availablity, popular routes taken, and popularity by month/day to improve usability and customer satisfaction. 


                                                        Exploration Questions
                                                        
 
 What is the distribution of membership types? 
 
 ![memberships](https://github.com/aclao89/LA_Metro_Bike/blob/master/Images/membership_types.png)
 
 63.4% of their membership base are monthly subscribers. 29.3% are walk-ups meaning customers just purchase on the spot without any membership enrollment. Generally, a company profits when their most of their customers have a subscription-based membership.
 
 
 Which day has the longest average trip duration?
 
 ![avg duration](https://github.com/aclao89/LA_Metro_Bike/blob/master/Images/avg_trip_duration_by_day.png)
 
 Sunday had the highest average duration of a trip. According to the total volume of rides by day, Sunday had the least amount.It's possible that customers are just taking longer trips or more traffic that contributes to the higher duration.
 
 
 Which day has the most volume of trips?
 
 
 ![daily_trips](https://github.com/aclao89/LA_Metro_Bike/blob/master/Images/daily_trips_by_week.png)
 
 It's not suprising to see that the highest trip volume is on Friday. 
 
 
 Which month has the most volume of trips? 
 
 ![monthly trips](
https://github.com/aclao89/LA_Metro_Bike/blob/master/Images/monthly_trips_2017.png)

The highest number of trips were during October 2017. This high volumn of trips might be related to the moderate weather (72Â°), tourism, and possibly school commute. It's expected to have a low volume during the cold winter months of January and February and steadily increase as Spring arrives.

 
 
 What are the most popular routes taken?

 Ocean Front Walk & Navy is in Venice Beach, a popular location for locals and tourists alike especially via bikes. Based on this chart, riders seem to take round trips in this area, perhaps it is near establishments.
